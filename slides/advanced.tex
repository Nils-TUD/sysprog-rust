\section{Advanced Features}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Unsafe}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Rust allows you to enable additional features via \texttt{unsafe}
        \item Tells the compiler that you know what you're doing
        \item Does \emph{not} turn off safety checks, but allows you additionally to:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Dereference raw pointers
            \item Call unsafe functions
            \item (Some more that are less important)
        \end{itemize}
        \item Unsafe code is typically used to build safe abstractions (\texttt{Vec}, \texttt{String}, \dots)
        \item Example:
        \begin{lstlisting}[language=rust]
let mut_ptr = 0xB8000 as *mut u32;         // VGA frame buffer
let const_ptr = 0xDEAD_BEEF as *const u32;
unsafe { *mut_ptr = *const_ptr; }
        \end{lstlisting}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

    \frametitle{Interfacing with Other Languages}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Rust can interface with other languages through the foreign function interface (FFI)
        \item Allows to call C functions from Rust:
        \begin{lstlisting}[language=rust]
extern "C" {
    fn abs(input: i32) -> i32;
}
unsafe { abs(-2) };
        \end{lstlisting}

        \pause

        \item And to export Rust functions to C:
        \begin{lstlisting}[language=rust]
#[no_mangle]
extern "C" fn rust_double(arg: u64) -> u64 {
    arg * 2
}
        \end{lstlisting}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Interior Mutability}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Design pattern that allows to bypass the ownership model
        \item Used by \texttt{Cell}, \texttt{RefCell}, \texttt{Mutex} and others

        \pause

        \item For example (from the kernel you'll work on):
        \begin{lstlisting}[language=rust]
pub struct StaticCell<T: Sized> { inner: UnsafeCell<T> }

impl<T: Sized> StaticCell<T> {
    pub const fn new(val: T) -> Self {
        StaticCell { inner: UnsafeCell::new(val) }
    }
    pub fn get_mut(&self) -> &mut T {
        unsafe { &mut *self.inner.get() }
    }
}
        \end{lstlisting}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Exercise 4 -- Semaphores}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Last exercise is in directory ``kernel''
        \item Simple kernel that supports exactly two programs and runs in physical memory
        \item The program is instantiated two times and performs prints in a loop
        \item The prints currently mix occasionally; use semaphores to prevent it
        \item You need:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Add block support for tasks (preemptive scheduling already implemented)
            \item Add the Semaphore itself (with up and down based on blockable tasks)
            \item Add up/down syscalls to the kernel
            \item Use the syscalls in the user program
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
